	  	<p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInLeft">Mirissa is the largest fishing port on the south coast and is known for its tuna, mullet, snapper, and butterfish. In 1980 the first tourist accommodation was built however it wasn't until the mid-1990s that tourism to the town started to dramatically increase.

		Mirissa was affected by the tsunami caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, with numerous homes, guesthouses, shops, schools, and temples destroyed or damaged and fourteen reported deaths.</p>

	  		  	<p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp">Perched on a slab of rock that juts dramatically over the forests of central Sri Lanka, Sigiriya is as imposing a sight now as it must have been when it was first built by a fierce king in the fifth century A.D. Meaning “lion’s rock,” Sigiriya (designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1982) is accessed by way of passageways cut into the rock face between a monumental pair of lion paws.</p>

	  	<p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInRight">The mountain was worshipped by the indigenous inhabitants of Sri Lanka, who called it the Samanalakanda, Saman being one of the four guardian deities of the island. Hindus call the mountain Sivan Adi Padham, as they believe the god Shiva left the giant footprint on the summit.</p>
